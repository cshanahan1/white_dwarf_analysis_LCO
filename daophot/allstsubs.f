C
C The stars are currently in a stack NSTAR stars long.  The variable 
C ITEST will point to the position in the stack occupied by the star 
C which is currently the center of a circle of the critical radius, 
C within which we are looking for other stars; this also starts out 
C with a value of 1.  ITOP points to the top position in the stack of 
C the stars which have not yet been assigned to groups; this starts 
C out with the value 2.  Each time through, the 
C program goes down through the stack from ITOP and looks for stars 
C within the critical distance from the star at stack position 
C ITEST.  When such a star is found, it changes places in the stack 
C with the star at ITOP and ITOP is incremented by one.  When the 
C search reaches a star J such that Y(J)-Y(ITEST) > CRIT it is known
C that no further stars will be found within the critical distance, the
C pointer ITEST is incremented by one, and the search proceeds again 
C from the new value of ITOP.  If the pointer ITEST catches up 
C with the pointer ITOP, that means that the group currently being 
C built up is complete.  Then a new group is started beginning with 
C the star at the current position ITEST, ( = the instantaneous 
C value of ITOP), ITOP is incremented by 1, and the next group is built
C up as before.
C

      LAST(ITEST)=.FALSE.
      IF (ITEST .EQ. ITOP) THEN
C
C ITEST has reached ITOP; no other unassigned stars are within a 
C critical separation of any member of the current group.  The group is 
C therefore complete.  Signify this by setting LAST(ITEST-1)=.TRUE.
C (ITEST = the current value of ITOP), and then increment the value of 
C ITOP by one.
C
         J=ITEST-1
         IF (J .GT. 0) LAST(J)=.TRUE.
         ITOP=ITOP+1                              ! Increment ITOP
C
C If ITOP is greater than NSTAR at this point, then we are finished 
C (the last group contains one star).  Otherwise, on with the search.

      END IF
C
C Now go through the list of unassigned stars, occupying positions ITOP
C through NSTAR in the stack, to look for stars within the critical 
C distance of the star at position ITEST in the stack.  If one is found,
C move it up to stack position ITOP and increment ITOP by one.

C
C This star is within the critical distance of the star at stack 
C position ITEST.  Therefore it should be added to the current group by
C moving it up to position ITOP in the stack, where the pointer ITEST 
C may eventually reach it.
C

C stack.

C If ITOP is greater than NSTAR, then all stars have been assigned to
